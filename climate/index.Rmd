## Description

The data set climate_change.csv contains atmospheric concentration data of C02, CH4 and N2O in mmpv from 1984-2008. We built an interactive interface where use can select the gas and starting year for a bar plot that displays the concentration levels throughout the years.

--- .

## Data Set
Example of data file
```{r}
data <- read.csv("climate_change.csv", sep=",", header=T)
head(data,10)
```

--- .

## Details

Two user inputs are required: Gas and Year. The graph will be automatically configured based on user inputs.

--- .

## Bar plot

The concentration in mmpv has been represented on a scale of 300 to 400 in order to demonstrate the incremental increases.

--- .

## Conclusion

Concentration levels of both CO2 and NH4 have been increasing over the past 20 years
